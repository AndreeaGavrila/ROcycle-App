# ROcycle-App

## **Erasmus+ Programme "Future Career? Touch IT!"**

- **Team Project** with [@IrinaMoisa]() 

- **General Info:**
  - Project developed in MIT (Google) App Inventor
  
  - _ROcycle's goal_ is to promote recycling in Romania. We want to bring awareness to the disastrous impact caused by pollution. We think we can encourage people to recycle, not just informing them of the complex selective recycling process, but also giving them discounts at supermarkets.

  - _MIT App Inventor_ is an online platform designed to teach computational thinking concepts through development of mobile applications. Students create applications by dragging and dropping components into a design view and using a visual blocks language to program application behavior.
